# Hi there!

Am a fully licenced amateur radio operator in the UK and love to tinker with radios and program in my spare time

- President (2024/25) of [@SurreyEARS](https://github.com/SurreyEARS), a student-led society owning our own makerspace
- Member of [@PerytonSpace](https://github.com/PerytonSpace) and have helped in many projects including the rocketry competitions and Stagworks

I like to document as much as I can when finding niche subjects that usually cause me issues so that other people will not have to go through the same process of struggling to find information - most of these are in GitHub pages as documentation, one I am currently adding to is the [EARS-cive](https://aircraftanorak.github.io/EARS-cive/) for projects related to our society
